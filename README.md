# Context Monkey

Non-invasive prompt engineering framework for Claude Code using project-aware specialized subagents.

## Install

```bash
npx context-monkey install
```

## Update

```bash
npx context-monkey upgrade
```

## Uninstall

```bash
npx context-monkey uninstall
```

## What is Context Monkey?

Context Monkey enhances Claude Code with **specialized subagents** that automatically understand your project:

- 🔍 **Code Reviewer** - Senior engineer-level code reviews with project context
- 📋 **Project Planner** - Risk-aware implementation planning using your tech stack
- 🗂️ **Repository Analyst** - Architecture mapping with project-specific insights
- 🔍 **Stack Detective** - Complete technology profiling and optimization
- 🔬 **Deep Researcher** - Thorough technical investigations

Each subagent operates in its own context window with specialized prompts **and embedded knowledge of your project's technology stack and development rules**.

## Claude Code Commands

Once installed, these enhanced slash commands delegate to specialized subagents:

- `/review-code [range]` → **Code Reviewer** subagent
- `/plan <goal>` → **Project Planner** subagent
- `/explain-repo [focus]` → **Repository Analyst** subagent  
- `/stack-scan [action]` → **Stack Detective** subagent
- `/deep-dive <topic>` → **Deep Researcher** subagent
- `/add-rule` - Add project rules
- `/edit-rule` - Edit existing rules

## How It Works

1. **Project Detection**: Context Monkey reads your `.monkey/stack.md` and `.monkey/rules.md` files
2. **Context Injection**: Project context is embedded directly into each subagent's prompt
3. **Specialized Execution**: Subagents operate with full project knowledge in isolated contexts
4. **Non-Invasive**: Your existing Claude Code setup (CLAUDE.md) remains untouched

## Architecture Benefits

**🎯 Project-Aware Intelligence**: Every subagent knows your tech stack, build commands, and development rules

**🏗️ Non-Invasive Setup**: Works alongside any existing Claude Code configuration without conflicts

**🔒 Context Isolation**: Subagents start with clean context windows, preventing "context soup"

**📊 Structured Output**: Consistent, scannable formats (🔴 Critical, 🟡 Warnings, 🟢 Suggestions)

**🔧 Focused Tools**: Each subagent only accesses relevant tools for its domain

**⚡ Fresh Context**: Every subagent invocation starts with up-to-date project context

## Project Context Files

Context Monkey uses two optional files in your `.monkey/` directory:

- **`.monkey/stack.md`** - Your technology stack (generated by `/stack-scan`)
- **`.monkey/rules.md`** - Your development rules (managed by `/add-rule`, `/edit-rule`)

If these files don't exist, subagents will suggest creating them for better project awareness.

## How Context Monkey Compares

Context Monkey occupies a unique position among AI development frameworks:

### vs. BMAD METHOD
- **Context Monkey**: Non-invasive specialized expertise with zero setup friction
- **BMAD METHOD**: Comprehensive methodology requiring full workflow adoption
- **Best for**: Context Monkey for immediate specialized help, BMAD for systematic development transformation

### vs. Task Master AI  
- **Context Monkey**: Domain-specific consultative subagents with project awareness
- **Task Master AI**: Task orchestration and parallel execution management
- **Best for**: Context Monkey for expert advice, Task Master for complex workflow coordination

### Context Monkey's Sweet Spot
- ✅ **Lower barrier to entry** than methodology frameworks
- ✅ **More specialized expertise** than orchestration engines  
- ✅ **Automatic project awareness** (competitors require manual setup)
- ✅ **Non-invasive by design** - enhances existing workflows without disruption

**In 30 seconds**: Get specialized AI expertise with full project knowledge, without changing anything about how you work.
