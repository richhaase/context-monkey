# Future Claude Code Features for Context Monkey

This document identifies specific Claude Code capabilities that context-monkey could leverage next.

## Priority Features to Implement

### 1. Hooks System
Currently not implemented. Hooks enable workflow automation:
- `PreToolUse` hooks to validate before file edits
- `SessionStart` hooks to auto-load project context
- `PostToolUse` hooks for automatic testing after code changes

**Impact**: High - enables automated workflows and quality gates

### ✅ 2. Command Composition - COMPLETED
Meta-commands that chain existing analyses for complete workflows:

#### ✅ `/cm:security-assessment` - COMPLETED
- **Flow**: cm-security-auditor → cm-dependency-manager → cm-reviewer
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive security evaluation across all attack surfaces
- **Output**: Integrated security report with vulnerability assessment and remediation plan
- **Features**: 3 analysis modes (quick/standard/deep), multi-layered security coverage

#### ✅ `/cm:onboard-project` - COMPLETED
- **Flow**: cm-stack-profiler → cm-repo-explainer → cm-planner
- **Purpose**: Complete project understanding for new team members
- **Output**: Comprehensive project briefing with setup instructions
- **Features**: 3 analysis modes (quick/standard/deep), sequential agent execution

**Impact**: High - provides complete workflow automation ✅ DELIVERED

### 2. MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration
**Status**: Considered premature - POC completed in `feat/mcp-servers` branch

Automatic MCP server deployment was prototyped but determined to be premature for Context Monkey's current scope. The implementation successfully demonstrated Sequential Thinking MCP server auto-deployment using `claude mcp add` commands.

**Impact**: Deferred - focused on core agent capabilities first

## Remaining Agents to Consider

### ✅ dependency-manager - COMPLETED
- **Purpose**: Dependency analysis, security scanning, and upgrade planning
- **Tools**: Read, Glob, Grep, Bash, WebSearch, WebFetch, Write, Edit
- **Impact**: High - critical for maintenance workflows - now available as cm-dependency-manager
- **Use Cases**: Multi-ecosystem dependency analysis, CVE scanning, upgrade planning, license compliance

### ✅ doc-generator - COMPLETED
- **Purpose**: Automated documentation generation and maintenance
- **Tools**: Read, Glob, Grep, Write, Edit, WebSearch
- **Impact**: Medium - developer productivity multiplier
- **Use Cases**: README generation, API docs, architecture documentation

### performance-profiler
- **Purpose**: Performance analysis and optimization recommendations
- **Tools**: Read, Glob, Grep, Bash(profiling tools), WebFetch
- **Impact**: Medium - essential for production systems
- **Use Cases**: Performance bottleneck detection, optimization suggestions

## Advanced Enhancements

### Context Enhancement
- **Dynamic README References**: Agents could reference `@README.md`, `@CONTRIBUTING.md`, `@ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Manifest File Loading**: Auto-load `@package.json`, `@Cargo.toml`, `@pyproject.toml` based on detected stack
- **Environment Context**: Reference `@.env.example` and deployment configs

### Workflow Automation
- **Pre-commit Integration**: Hooks that auto-run code review before commits
- **CI/CD Awareness**: Agents that understand GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins pipelines
- **Issue Tracker Integration**: Connect planning agents with GitHub Issues, Jira tickets

### Performance Enhancements
- **Intelligent Caching**: Cache file content, search results, and external research
- **Progressive Analysis**: Quick/standard/deep analysis modes with different time/depth trade-offs
- **Context Validation**: Timestamp-based context freshness checking

## Implementation Priority

**Immediate Focus**:
1. **Hooks System**: PreToolUse/PostToolUse validation and workflow automation

**Future Consideration**:
1. **Doc Generator**: Automated documentation generation agent (lower priority)
2. **Performance Profiler**: Performance analysis and optimization agent (niche use case)
3. **Advanced Context Enhancement**: Dynamic manifest loading and README references

## Completed Features ✅

- **Plan Mode Integration**: All analytical commands support safe exploration
- **Multi-tool Parallel Execution**: Performance optimized with batched operations
- **Advanced Tool Permissions**: Comprehensive tool access across all agents
- **Dynamic Context Loading**: Project-aware analysis with `@.cm/` references
- **Upgrade System**: Self-healing pattern-based file management
- **Security Auditor**: Comprehensive security analysis agent
- **Error Handling**: Robust recovery protocols across all agents
- **Command Composition**: Multi-agent workflows with `/cm:onboard-project` and `/cm:security-assessment`
- **Dependency Manager**: Multi-ecosystem dependency analysis and security scanning agent
