# Intent

Provide a comprehensive overview of the repository to help users understand the codebase structure, key components, and areas of interest.

# Implementation

Use the general-purpose agent to analyze the repository and provide a structured explanation covering:

1. **Purpose & Overview** - What the project does
2. **Architecture** - How it's organized
3. **Key Components** - Critical files and directories
4. **Entry Points** - Main files and startup processes
5. **Areas of Interest** - Suggest topics for `/deep-dive [topic]`

The agent should examine README files, package configurations, source structure, and key implementation files to build this understanding.
