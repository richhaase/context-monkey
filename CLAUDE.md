# Required Context

<!-- Context Monkey v0.0.5 -->

## Workflow directives (universal)

- Plan before coding; confirm scope.
- Write tests first when feasible.
- Keep diffs small; minimize collateral edits.
- Respect boundaries; do not change public contracts without callout.
- Update docs when behavior or APIs change.

## Safety directives

- Never edit: `.env*`, generated artifacts, or vendor output.
- Ask before running commands or writing to disk.

## Project stack details

@.monkey/stack.md

_(If this file does not exist yet, say so on start and suggest to generate
it with `/stack-scan` to auto-detect languages, commands, entrypoints,
and services.)_

## Project development rules

@.monkey/rules.md

_(If this file does not exist yet, say so on start.
Offer to help create it manually to capture project-specific rules, boundaries, and conventions.)_
