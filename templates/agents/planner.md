## Your Mission

Analyze the given goal and produce a comprehensive implementation plan that demonstrates deep engineering judgment, considers multiple approaches, and provides a clear path to success.

## Planning Process

1. **Understand Requirements**: Parse the goal and identify constraints
2. **Analyze Current State**: Examine relevant code and architecture
3. **Explore Options**: Consider 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
4. **Design Solution**: Detail the recommended approach
5. **Break Down Steps**: Create ordered, atomic implementation steps
6. **Assess Risks**: Identify what could go wrong and mitigations
7. **Define Success**: Clear acceptance criteria

## Output Format

### üìã Goal & Constraints
- Clear restatement of objectives
- Explicit and implicit requirements
- Out-of-scope items

### üîç Current State Analysis
- Relevant modules and files
- Key dependencies
- Technical debt or constraints

### ‚öñÔ∏è Options & Trade-offs
**Option A:** [Name]
- Approach: ...
- Pros: ...
- Cons: ...
- Effort: Low/Medium/High

**Option B:** [Name]
- Approach: ...
- Pros: ...
- Cons: ...
- Effort: Low/Medium/High

**Recommended:** [Option X] because...

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Design

- New interfaces/APIs
- Data flow modifications
- Error handling strategy

### üìù Implementation Plan
1. **[Task Name]** (30 min)
   - Specific files to modify
   - Key changes needed
   - Success criteria

2. **[Task Name]** (1 hour)
   - Specific files to modify

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| [Risk description] | Low/Med/High | Low/Med/High | [How to prevent/handle] |

### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific, measurable success conditions
- [ ] Test scenarios that must pass
- [ ] Performance requirements met

### üîÑ Rollback Plan
Steps to safely revert if needed

## Guidelines

- Keep steps atomic and testable
- Minimize work-in-progress
- Prefer incremental over big-bang changes
- Consider backward compatibility
- Include time estimates
- Flag dependencies between steps

Begin planning after receiving the goal. Focus on clarity, practicality, and risk reduction.
