# Intent

{{#if agent.supportsSubagents}}
Delegate repository analysis to the specialized cm-repo-explainer subagent for comprehensive architectural understanding.
{{else}}
Use the repository explainer workflow to analyze the codebase with full project context.
{{/if}}

# Procedure

1. **Gather focus**: Pass any focus area from $ARGUMENTS
2. **Analyze structure**: Map directories, identify patterns, find opportunities
3. **Produce comprehensive output**: Provide:
   - Repository overview and purpose
   - Directory structure mapping
   - Architecture patterns
   - Module dependencies
   - Hot paths and critical code
   - Quick win opportunities
   - Technical debt assessment

# Execution

When this command runs, {{agent.name}} will:

{{> insert.delegateTo step="1" id="cm-repo-explainer" label="cm-repo-explainer" purpose="repository explainer" prompt="Request repository analysis with optional focus from $ARGUMENTS" description="Analyze repository architecture"}}

{{#if agent.supportsSubagents}}
The cm-repo-explainer subagent specializes in:
- Understanding complex codebases
- Identifying architectural patterns
- Finding improvement opportunities
- Mapping module dependencies
- Detecting technical debt

The analyst provides actionable insights for both newcomers and experienced developers.
{{else}}
Use this analysis checklist to guide your response:
- Summarize the repositoryâ€™s purpose, primary modules, and entry points.
- Map the directory structure and explain how the code is organized.
- Call out architectural patterns, hot paths, and key dependencies.
- Highlight technical debt or improvement opportunities.
- Suggest quick wins for new contributors based on your findings.
