# Intent

Delegate code review to the specialized code-reviewer subagent for comprehensive analysis of changes.

# Procedure

1. **Gather changes**: Get git diff based on arguments
   - No arguments â†’ review uncommitted changes (`git diff HEAD`)
   - Commit range â†’ review range (`git diff main..HEAD`)
   - File paths â†’ review specific files (`git diff HEAD -- file.js`)
   - HEAD~N â†’ review last N commits

2. **Invoke subagent**: Pass diff to code-reviewer subagent

3. **Subagent provides**: Structured review with:
   - ðŸ”´ CRITICAL (Must Fix) - bugs, security issues
   - ðŸŸ¡ WARNINGS (Should Fix) - maintainability, performance
   - ðŸŸ¢ SUGGESTIONS (Consider) - enhancements, alternatives
   - âœ… GOOD PRACTICES - positive reinforcement

# Execution

When this command runs, Claude Code will:

1. Use Bash tool to get the appropriate git diff based on $ARGUMENTS
2. Use Task tool to invoke the code-reviewer subagent with:
   - subagent_type: "general-purpose" (since code-reviewer isn't a built-in type)
   - prompt: Include the diff output and request for code review
   - description: "Code review of changes"

The code-reviewer subagent will analyze the changes with senior engineer expertise, checking for correctness, design, security, performance, and style issues.
